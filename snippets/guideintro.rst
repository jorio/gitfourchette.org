Welcome to |App|, the comfortable Git UI for Linux!

Explore your repositories easily. Craft commits intuitively.  With its
comfortable Qt interface, |App| will become your sidekick to navigate and get
work done in your Git repositories.

This document is part user's guide, part reference.  It will get you up to speed
on common use cases so you can feel at home in |App|.  Interspersed throughout
the guide are command tables detailing more advanced features.

This guide assumes you're familiar with the basic tenets of Git, especially
commits, branches, and remotes.  If you need a refresher on those, I recommend
skimming chapters 2 and 3 of `the "Pro Git" book
<https://git-scm.com/book>`_---or, for a more relaxed read, `"How Git Works"
<https://wizardzines.com/zines/git>`_.  These books will teach you some Git
commands, but the very same concepts apply in |App|.
